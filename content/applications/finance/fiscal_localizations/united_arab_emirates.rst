Chart of accounts

Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Chart of Accounts` to view all default
accounts available for your localization package. You can filter by :guilabel:`code` using the
numbers on the far left or by clicking on :menuselection:`Group By --> Account Type`. You can

   Always keep at least one **Receivable Account** and one **Payable Account** active. It is also

Taxes
=====

To access your taxes, head to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`.
Activate/deactivate, or :doc:`configure </applications/finance/accounting/taxation/taxes/taxes>` the
taxes relevant to your business by clicking on them. Remember only to set accounts on the **5%** tax
group, as other groups do not need closing.

.. tip::
   Use the :guilabel:`Group By --> Tax Type` filter to group taxes by type and have a clear overview
   of the different taxes.

Tax report
----------

To create a tax report when closing your period, head to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting
--> Tax Report`. The closing period corresponds to the period configured in
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Taxes`, but you can always change it
by clicking on the **calendar icon** and selecting the period you wish to close.

Journals
--------

To configure your journals, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`. You
can modify the pre-configured journals according to your needs or create new journals with five
possible types: **Sales, Purchase, Bank, Cash**, and **Miscellaneous**.

Currency exchange rates
-----------------------

Currency exchange rates are automatically updated using the U.A.E Central Bank rates, but by default
the interval is set to *manual*. If you wish to use the automated currency rate update, change the
interval to your desired frequency under :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings
--> Currencies`.

It is also possible to use web services other than the **U.A.E Central Bank**, such as **xe.com** or
the **European Central Bank**. To do so, click on the drop-down menu of the :guilabel:`Service`
field and select one of the services.

.. _uae/payroll:

Payroll
=======

The :guilabel:`U.A.E. - Payroll` module includes all the rules configured under the
:guilabel:`U.A.E. Employee Payroll Structure` in the **Salary Rules** section as per the U.A.E.
rules and regulations. These rules are linked to their corresponding accounts in the **Chart of
Accounts**.

Salary rules
------------

To apply these rules to an employee's contract, go to :menuselection:`Payroll --> Contracts -->
Contracts` and select the contract's employee. In the :guilabel:`Salary Structure Type` field,
select :guilabel:`UAE Employee`.

.. image:: united_arab_emirates/uae-localization-salary-structure.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Select the Salary Structure Type to apply to the contract.

Under the :guilabel:`Salary Information` tab, you can find details such as:

- :guilabel:`Wage`;
- :guilabel:`Housing Allowance`;
- :guilabel:`Transportation Allowance`;
- :guilabel:`Other Allowances`;
- :guilabel:`Number of Days`: how the **End of Service Provision** is calculated.

.. note::
   **Leave deduction** is calculated using a salary rule linked to the unpaid leave time-off type;
   however, any other deductions or reimbursements are done *manually* using other inputs.
   Additionally, **overtime** is added *manually* through :menuselection:`Work Entries --> Work
   Entries`, and **salary attachments** are generated from :menuselection:`Contracts --> Salary
   Attachments`. :guilabel:`Create` an attachment and select the :guilabel:`Employee` and the
   :guilabel:`Type (Attachment of Salary, Assignment of Salary, Child Support)`.

.. tip::
   If you wish to avoid a rule to appearing on a paycheck, go to :menuselection:`Payroll -->
   Configuration --> Structures`. Click on the **U.A.E. structure**, select the rule to hide, and
   uncheck :guilabel:`Appears on Payslip`.

End of Service Provision
------------------------

The provision is defined as the total monthly allowance *divided* by 30 and then *multiplied* by the
number of days set in the field :guilabel:`Number of days` at the bottom of a contract's form.

The provision is then calculated via a salary rule associated with two accounts: the **End Of
Service Indemnity (Expense account)** and the **End of Service Provision (Non-current Liabilities
account)**. The latter is used to pay off the **End of service** amount by settling it with the
**Payables account**.

.. note::
   The **End of service** calculations is based on the gross salary according to the United Arab
   Emirates' HR laws. The start and end dates of the employeeâ€™s contracts trigger the calculations.

Invoices
--------

Invoices generated with the U.A.E localization installed can be in English, Arabic, or both. The
localization also includes a line to display the **VAT amount** per line.
